This is a project to implement a complete package for interval exchange maps manipulation under [SAGE](http://www.sagemath.org). It's possible to use flipped permutations and flipped generalized permutations which appears with measured foliations on non-orientable surfaces.

We developp a SAGE package but it's for now (approximately) pure python. So, there is two version, a python one, which just need python (and eventually Numpy for integer matrix and Networkx for graphs), and a SAGE version, which use a lot of SAGE features.

Currently we are in active development but the library could be used following the README instructions.
