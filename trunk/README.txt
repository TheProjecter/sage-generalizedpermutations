Those files define general tools for usage and manipualition of
(generalized) permutation under SAGE. Those mathematical objects 
are encountered in the theory of translations surfaces (and also 
word combinatorics) and more generally in the theory measured 
foliations of surfaces.

The main file is generalized_permutation.py, so for usage just do :

from generalized_permutation import *
