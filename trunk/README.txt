Those files define general tools for usage and manipulation of
(generalized) permutations under SAGE. Those mathematical objects 
are encountered in the theory of translations surfaces (and also 
word combinatorics) and more generally in the theory measured 
foliations of surfaces.

For now, the project is pure python and doesn't need SAGE. At term,
it will need some features of Matrix, Words, Permutation and Graph.

The main file is generalized_permutation.py, so for usage just do :

from generalized_permutation import *

It's distribution is under GPL
