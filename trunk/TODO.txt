* document everything, construction of exemples

* flipped permutations

* computation of strata (for oriented permutations)

* correspondance cc of strata <-> Rauzy diagrams (from Zorich works)
    - computation of spin
    - explicit permutations of strata

* implement a better way to consider Path in Rauzy diagrams

* enumeration of dynamically/geometrically irreducible permutations

* consider length and induction on length
