A list of thing to do in order (or not)


* modify the order of execution of is_reducible for quadratic differentials. Find better examples to test


* merge the pythonic version into SAGE :
   - consider SageObject  (in particuliar the special __latex__ method)
   - usage of WordMorphism
   - usage of native Alphabet for labelization
   - usage of Matrix
   - RauzyDiagram as a child of Graph


* better documentation including references, construction of more examples


* implement a better and more systematic way to consider Path in Rauzy diagrams (using iterator for example)


* flipped permutations


* computation of strata (for oriented permutations)


* correspondance cc of strata <-> Rauzy diagrams (from Zorich works)
    - create a objects for strata
    - computation of spin
    - explicit permutations of strata


* enumeration of dynamically/geometrically irreducible permutations


* consider lengths and induction on lengths (Rauzy moves) and corresponding path in Rauzy diagrams
